# ubuntu-low-mem-popup
Script to show a popup message when your machine is low on memory

This is cloned & modified script from https://askubuntu.com/questions/234292/warning-when-available-ram-approaches-zero

The purpose for this is when there is low memory on host machine and the system starts swapping then a huge lag occurs (at least on SSD disk)
